# NumPy Terminology

Understanding the terminology used in the NumPy documentation is critical to 
building a coherent mental model for the underlying concept/process that is
being described.
There are several places where (for me anyway) the terminology is difficult
to keep straight.
Here's a running list of terminological clusters that could be expanded on:

 - Terminology related to types, dtypes, scalars
   * `type`, `dtype`, `descr`, array scalar vs. Pythons scalar
 - *Along* vs. *Over* in the context of the `axis=` kwarg.
