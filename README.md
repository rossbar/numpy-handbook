# NumPy-Handbook

**Warning:** this project is under active development --- the organization,
repository structure, and even the name are subject to change at any time!

This is the repository for a NumPy handbook: an executable, technical "book"
that aims to provide a detailed and example-based examination of the NumPy
library.

## Existing books/resources for learning NumPy

There are many excellent resources currently available for learning NumPy,
including (but certainly not limited to):
