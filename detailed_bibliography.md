## [Guide to NumPy][GTN]

The original "textbook" on NumPy. Though it is nearly 15 years old, the 
material is still relevant, particularly for those interested in a more 
detailed description of the fundamental concepts behind NumPy's core features,
e.g. `ndarray` and `ufuncs`. The book is presented in two parts; the first
introducing NumPy and the second covering NumPy's C-API. Note that the
official NumPy [User Guide][user] and [Reference Guide][reference] draw 
heavily from this book, thus all of the material in this book is also 
available (and more up-to-date) in the official NumPy documentation.

## [From Python to NumPy][FPTN]

This excellent textbook targets current NumPy users who are already familiar
with the basics of array computing in NumPy. The main focus of the book is
how to solve problems using *vectorization*, and presents useful ways to 
categorize common problems to identify where and how vectorization can be 
applied to improve performance.
